# disaster-hub-locator

A web page that aggregates URLs for disaster management headquarters of each prefecture in Japan. The page will be designed to provide easy access to these important resources, helping users quickly find and navigate to their respective prefecture's disaster management website. The layout should be user-friendly, with a clean and straightforward design that categorizes each prefecture clearly for easy navigation. Ideally, the website will also be responsive, ensuring accessibility from both desktop and mobile devices. Since this is a prototype, actual URLs will need to be added by the user through the UI, allowing for customization and updates as needed.
